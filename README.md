# Loan_Pred_ML

# Loan Approval Prediction

This project uses machine learning to predict whether a loan application will be approved based on applicant data.

## Tech Stack
- Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn)
- Jupyter Notebook
- (Later: Flask for deployment)

## Features
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Preprocessing & Feature Engineering
- ML Model Training (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, etc.)
- Model Evaluation
- Web App with Flask (optional)

  
## üõ†Ô∏è Workflow
- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Feature Encoding (LabelEncoder)
- Model Training:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Random Forest Classifier
- Model Evaluation (Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, F1 Score)
- Feature Importance Visualization

## üìä Results

| Model                | Accuracy | Class 1 Recall | Class 0 Recall |
|---------------------|----------|----------------|----------------|
| Logistic Regression | 78.8%    | 99%            | 42%            |
| Random Forest       | 76.4%    | 95%            | 42%            |

## üìå Next Steps
- Improve model with hyperparameter tuning
- Build a Flask web app for predictions
